     estimated scf accuracy    <          5.8E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.580845 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -56.69750928 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      30.09804498 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.33201981 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       0.79155059 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59810786 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00407747 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
