     Parallel version (MPI), running on    10 processors
     R & G space division:  proc/nbgrp/npool/nimage =      10
     Reading input from H2O-1000x.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     Subspace diagonalization in iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem:
     a serial algorithm will be used
