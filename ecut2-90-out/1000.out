     estimated scf accuracy    <          8.3E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.643341 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -58.59445863 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      31.14450085 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.47430067 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       1.71420078 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59047928 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00407750 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
