     estimated scf accuracy    <          7.6E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.777370 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -59.63065453 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      31.60289183 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.52276035 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       2.21047010 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59043586 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
