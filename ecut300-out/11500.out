     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -34.58787389 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.4E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -59.75107225 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      31.49967298 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.53403360 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       2.19348152 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00407747 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
