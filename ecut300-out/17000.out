!    total energy              =     -34.57333853 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -34.57333854 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          7.7E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -58.11947808 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      30.65796443 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.39503382 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       1.28320893 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
