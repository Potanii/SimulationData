     the Fermi energy is    -6.2251 ev

!    total energy              =     -34.53951661 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -34.53951661 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          3.4E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -58.92927072 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      31.14584088 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.47436505 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       1.71420078 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00407751 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  22 iterations
