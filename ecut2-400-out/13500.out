     estimated scf accuracy    <          4.3E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.542779 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -55.74915608 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      29.72855609 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.27198072 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       0.18891533 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59630963 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00407747 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
