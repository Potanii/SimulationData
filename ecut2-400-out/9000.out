     estimated scf accuracy    <          4.4E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.700613 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -58.71017218 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      31.20025973 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.46184332 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       1.70768183 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.58965805 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
