     the Fermi energy is    -4.9484 ev

!    total energy              =     -43.90194115 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -43.90194115 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          5.8E-10 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.748823 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -60.35348807 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      31.92702233 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.59350171 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       2.70945129 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59142498 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  21 iterations
