!    total energy              =     -34.53070081 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -34.53070082 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          8.4E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -57.24112211 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      30.23176868 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.33379288 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       0.81244550 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  21 iterations
