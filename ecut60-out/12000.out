     the Fermi energy is    -6.2766 ev

!    total energy              =     -34.65454069 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -34.65454069 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          5.4E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -60.86519831 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      32.10931412 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.58825329 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       2.68549251 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00410428 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  21 iterations
