     the Fermi energy is    -4.7520 ev

!    total energy              =     -34.57215528 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -34.57215528 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.9E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -58.11682767 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      30.65601979 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.39455633 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       1.28320893 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  21 iterations
