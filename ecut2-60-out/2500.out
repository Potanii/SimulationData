     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -43.89486011 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          5.8E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.741741 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -63.54154160 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      33.41931660 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.82814051 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       4.64385515 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59242721 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00407747 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
