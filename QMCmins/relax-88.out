     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -34.18366145 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          2.0E-11 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -63.65947578 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      33.25126949 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.35530595 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       4.57985082 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in   5 iterations
