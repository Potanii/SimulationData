     hartree contribution      =      33.25272630 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.35554114 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       4.58203090 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in   6 iterations

     Forces acting on atoms (Ry/au):

     atom    1 type  1   force =    -0.00010258    0.00062653   -0.00000949
     atom    2 type  1   force =    -0.00055609    0.00028165   -0.00024833
     atom    3 type  2   force =     0.00065867   -0.00090818    0.00025782

     Total force =     0.001476     Total SCF correction =     0.000011

     bfgs converged in   8 scf cycles and   6 bfgs steps
     (criteria: energy <  1.0E-04, force <  1.0E-03)
