     estimated scf accuracy    <          6.7E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.634691 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -56.90175863 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      30.23247610 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.33406469 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       0.81244550 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59690829 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
