     estimated scf accuracy    <          9.6E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.759603 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -60.53959687 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      32.10967337 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.58859655 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       2.68549252 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.58379624 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00410229 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
