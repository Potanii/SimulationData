     estimated scf accuracy    <          5.7E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.474648 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -55.78298837 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      29.60925285 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.32492802 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       0.46753247 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59858295 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00194738 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
