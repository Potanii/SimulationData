     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.4E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.594071 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -57.10618427 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      30.33542692 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.38762048 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       1.00271754 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59560721 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00407747 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
