     estimated scf accuracy    <          6.9E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.794692 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -61.63456698 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      32.50916663 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.67284894 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       3.44255044 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59211205 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  21 iterations
