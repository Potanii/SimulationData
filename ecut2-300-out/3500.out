     one-electron contribution =     -60.62625526 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      31.99330482 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.58970088 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       2.92270837 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.59484216 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  20 iterations
