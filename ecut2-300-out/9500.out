!    total energy              =     -43.94187356 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -43.94187356 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          1.4E-09 Ry

     total all-electron energy =      -152.788755 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -60.24058967 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      31.92164347 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.56736235 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       2.53203650 Ry
     one-center paw contrib.   =      -9.58760151 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  21 iterations
