     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -55.96968879 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      29.47121927 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.41066409 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       0.61240103 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =      -0.00253018 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  21 iterations
