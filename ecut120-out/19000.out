!    total energy              =     -34.69061078 Ry
     Harris-Foulkes estimate   =     -34.69061079 Ry
     estimated scf accuracy    <          6.6E-09 Ry

     The total energy is the sum of the following terms:

     one-electron contribution =     -61.96995257 Ry
     hartree contribution      =      32.50956393 Ry
     xc contribution           =      -8.67277258 Ry
     ewald contribution        =       3.44255044 Ry
     smearing contrib. (-TS)   =       0.00000000 Ry

     convergence has been achieved in  21 iterations
